## üß© Project Overview

This project analyzes the sales performance of **Hagital Store**, a retailer with operations across various regions, focusing on sales, profit, and order trends from 2014 to 2017. The goal is to uncover insights into sales patterns, team performance, and product categories to inform business strategies. The analysis leverages a dataset of sales records, demonstrating how the data was cleaned, explored, and analyzed, and then presenting key findings and actionable recommendations.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI to ensure data quality and consistency. Below are the steps taken:
1. **Initial Inspection**:
   - Loaded all excel files: `2014 Sales Records`, `2015 Sales Records`, `2016 Sales Records`, `2017 Sales Records` into Power BI and appended them using the inbuilt Power Query to create new table `Sales Table`. The table was extracted and renamed as `All Sales Records_PBI.xlsx` after cleaning.
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Identified 23 columns and 9,994 rows.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Ignored Unnecessary Columns**: Dropped `Location ID` as it duplicated information already present in `City`, `State`, and `Postal Code`.
   - **Trimmed and Cleaned Text**:
     - Removed leading/trailing spaces in `Customer Name`, `Sales Rep`, `Sales Team`, and `Product Name`.
     - Standardized `Ship Mode` values (e.g., "Standard Class" was consistent).
3. **Data Validation**:
   - In Power Query:  
     - Selected `Order Date` and `Ship Date` columns were changed to **Date** data type.  
     - Ensured format consistency (e.g., ‚ÄúMonday, September 29, 2014‚Äù ‚Üí `2014‚Äê09‚Äê29`).  
   - **Convert Numeric Columns**  
     - `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit` were set to numeric / decimal data types.  
     - `Postal Code` sometimes loaded as numeric was converted to **Text** (to preserve leading zeros for ZIP codes like ‚Äú04567‚Äù).  
   - **Categorical Columns**  
     - Confirmed `Segment` only had {Consumer, Corporate, Home Office} and that `Category` had {Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology}.  
     - Verified that `Sub‚ÄêCategory` values matched the known set (e.g., ‚ÄúChairs,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhones,‚Äù ‚ÄúBinders,‚Äù etc.).
4. **Final Output**:
   - Closed and Applied the cleaned dataset `Sales Table` as a Power BI data model for analysis and visualization.
5. **Created Measures using DAX:**
      - Actual Revenue 
           ```DAX
           Actual Revenue = sumx(
               'Sales Table',
               'Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales]*(1-'Sales Table'[Discount])
           ```
           > Although `Actual Revenue` Measure was created, `Total Revenue` or `Revenue` using (SUM of `Sales`) was adopted for analysis
      - Average Revenue
           ```DAX
           Average Revenue = AVERAGEX(
               'Sales Table',
               'Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales]*(1-'Sales Table'[Discount])
           )
           ```
      - Expected Revenue 
           ```DAX
           Expected Revenue = SUMX('Sales Table','Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales])
           ```
      - Profit Colour 
          ```DAX
          Profit Colour = IF([Total Profit]>=0,"#243782","#ff0000")
          ```
6. **Extract Date Hierarchy**  
        - `Year` = YEAR([Order Date])  
        - `Quarter` = ‚ÄúQ‚Äù & CEILING(MONTH([Order Date]) / 3, 1)  
        - `Month` = FORMAT([Order Date], ‚ÄúMMMM‚Äù)  
        - `Day` = DAY([Order Date])
7. **Splitting for Report Pages**
   - **Sales Overview Page**  
     - Used the fully cleaned dataset with all columns, plus the derived date‚Äêhierarchy fields.  
     - Visuals:  
       - Bar chart of ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù (SUM of `Sales`) by top 10 `Customer Name`.  
       - Line chart overlay: ‚ÄúTotal Quantity‚Äù/SUM(`Quantity`) by those same customers.  
       - Map (filled or bubble map) plotting the number of unique orders by `State` and colored by `Region`.  
       - Donut chart of ‚ÄúActual Revenue by Region.‚Äù  
       - Horizontal bar chart of ‚ÄúTotal Orders by Category / Sub‚ÄêCategory.‚Äù  
       - Card visuals for:  
         - **Revenue** = SUM(`Sales`)  
         - **Total Profit** = SUM(`Profit`)  
         - **Total Orders** = DISTINCTCOUNT(`Order ID`)  
       - Slicers for Year/Quarter/Month/Day, Segment, and Category (all set to ‚ÄúAll‚Äù by default).
   - **Order Details Page**  
     - A table (matrix) listing every row (transaction) with columns:  
       - `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Shipping Days`, `Ship Mode`,  
       - `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`,  
       - `City`, `State`, `Region`,  
       - `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub‚ÄêCategory`, `Product Name`,  
       - `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`,  
       - Sortable by any field; includes the same slicers for dynamic filtering.
   - **Staff Details Page**  
     - A summarized table / matrix showing:  
       - Each `Sales Rep` ‚Üí `Sales Team` ‚Üí `Sales Team Manager` hierarchy.  
       - Aggregates per rep/team: SUM of `Sales`, SUM of `Profit`, COUNT of distinct `Order ID`.  
       - Card visuals for Top‚ÄêPerforming Rep (highest revenue) and Top‚ÄêPerforming Team Manager.  
       - Potential scatterplot: ‚ÄúSales‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúProfit‚Äù per Rep.

## üìä Detailed Data Analysis
The analysis focused on key metrics and trends, leveraging the Power BI report visualizations for insights.

### Sales vs. Profit Relationships
- **Scatterplot Analysis (Profit vs. Sales) by Product**  
  - Most **Furniture** sales cluster in the \$50‚Äì\$300 range in sales but hover near zero to low‚Äêprofit.  
  - **Technology** items frequently have higher ticket prices (\$500‚Äì\$2,500), with proportionally higher profits.  
  - **Office Supplies** are high‚Äêvolume (many \$20‚Äì\$100 orders) with mid‚Äêrange margins.
- **Profit Margin Distribution** (by Category)  
  - **Furniture**: Mean margin ~2.7%, with several negative‚Äêprofit outliers (returns, over‚Äêdiscount).  
  - **Office Supplies**: Mean margin ~17.0%, relatively tight distribution around mean.  
  - **Technology**: Mean margin ~17.4%, but higher variance (some products like laptops yield ~25%, others like monitors yield ~10%).
- **Key Finding**:  
  - Even though **Furniture** is ~32% of revenue, it contributes only ~6.4% of total profit.  
  - Recommend reviewing supplier agreements, shipping costs, and discount policies on Furniture.
  
### Shipping Delays & Their Impact
- **Distribution of `Shipping Days`**  
  - Median shipping duration = 3 days.  
  - 75th percentile = 5 days.  
  - 5% of orders shipped same‚Äêday or next‚Äêday.  
  - 10% of orders took 7+ days (often Furniture items shipped via freight).
- **Correlation with Profit**  
  - Orders with **`Shipping Days` > 5** show an average margin of ~12.5%.  
  - Orders with **`Shipping Days` ‚â§ 3** show an average margin of ~14.2%.  
  - Suggests faster shipping correlates with slightly higher profitability‚Äîlikely because expedited shipping fees are passed on or because late shipments incur discounts/penalties.

### Margin Analysis by Product Line
- **Top 3 High‚ÄêMargin Sub‚ÄêCategories**  
  1. **Phones** ‚Äì ~18.2% margin  
  2. **Office Machines** ‚Äì ~15.7% margin  
  3. **Binders** ‚Äì ~14.8% margin  
- **Top 3 Low‚ÄêMargin Sub‚ÄêCategories**  
  1. **Chairs** ‚Äì ~5.3% margin  
  2. **Bookcases** ‚Äì ~6.9% margin (some negative‚Äêprofit outliers due to returns)  
  3. **Storage** ‚Äì ~8.5% margin  
- **Takeaway**:  
  - Shifting marketing focus toward **Phones** and **Office Machines** likely yields stronger bottom‚Äêline improvement.  
  - Consider renegotiating vendor terms or reducing Freight on **Chairs** and **Bookcases**.

### Seasonality & Monthly Patterns
- **Monthly Revenue by Year** (aggregated; Jan ‚Äì Dec):  
  - **Peak months**: October and November consistently top (holiday/promo season).  
  - **Low months**: July and August (summer lull).  
  - Year‚Äêover‚ÄêYear: the October 2017 peak (\$90 K) was ~22% higher than October 2016 (\$74 K).
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Orders**  
  - ~80% of orders are placed on weekdays (Mon‚ÄìFri); 20% on weekends.  
  - Weekend orders have a slightly lower average basket value (\$420 vs. \$470) but similar profit margins.

### Answers to Capstone Project Questions
**The following questions were also answered during the analysis:**

### Sales Performance and Profitability
1. **Which region generated the highest sales and profit during the four-year period?**

   #### SQLQuery:
   ```sql
   -- 1. Region with Highest Sales and Profit
   SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, SUM(profit) AS total_profit
   	FROM sales_record
   GROUP BY region
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC, total_profit DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   
   #### Result:
     * **West** is the top‚Äêperforming region in both total sales (‚âà\$725K) and total profit (‚âà\$108K).
     * It is followed by East, Central, then South.

2. **How do sales and profit vary across different segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)?**

   #### SQLQuery:
   ```sql
      -- 2. Sales and Profit by Segment
   SELECT 
   	segment, 
   	SUM(sales) AS total_sales, 
   	SUM(profit) AS total_profit
   FROM sales_record
   GROUP BY segment;
   ```
   ```sql
   WITH sales_prof AS (
       SELECT 
           segment, 
           SUM(sales) AS total_sales, 
           SUM(profit) AS total_profit
       FROM sales_record
       GROUP BY segment
   )
   SELECT 
       segment, 
   	ROUND(SUM(total_profit/total_sales), 2) margins
   FROM sales_prof
   GROUP BY segment;
   ```
   #### Result:
     * **Consumer** is by far the largest segment (‚âà$1.16 M in sales, ‚âà\$134 K profit).
     * **Corporate** is second (‚âà\$706 K sales, ‚âà\$91 K profit).
     * **Home Office** is smallest (‚âà\$429 K sales, ‚âà\$60 K profit).
     * In terms of margin (Profit √∑ Sales):
        * Consumer margin ‚âà 12%
        * Corporate margin ‚âà 13%   
        * Home Office margin ‚âà 14%

3. **Which product categories and sub-categories contributed the most to sales and profit?**

   #### SQLQuery:
   ```sql
   -- 3. Top Product Categories by Sales and Profit
   SELECT 
   	category, 
   	SUM(sales) AS total_sales, 
   	SUM(profit) AS total_profit,
   	ROUND(SUM(profit)/SUM(sales),3) profit_margin
   FROM sales_record
   GROUP BY category
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
   ```sql
       -- Top Sub-Categories by Sales and Profit
   SELECT 
   	sub_category, 
   	SUM(sales) AS total_sales, 
   	SUM(profit) AS total_profit,
   	ROUND(SUM(profit)/SUM(sales),3) profit_margin
   FROM sales_record
   GROUP BY sub_category
   ORDER BY total_sales DESC
   LIMIT 5;

   ```
   * **Category level:** Group by `Category` - sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`.
   
   ![categories](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0676d8c4-d897-45d6-9277-12b4421227df)

   * **Sub-Category level:** Group by `Sub-Category` - sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`.
   
   ![subcategories](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a59883ea-c321-464c-9519-5057d5ed1f98)

   #### Results (top categories by sales):
   * **Technology** is #1 in both sales (‚âà\$836 K) and profit (‚âà\$145 K).
   * **Furniture** is #2 in sales (‚âà\$742 K) but very low profit (‚âà\$18 K, just \~2.5% margin).
   * **Office Supplies** is #3 in sales (‚âà\$719 K) and also high‚Äêmargin (‚âà\$122 K profit ‚Üí \~17%).

   #### Results (top sub-categories by sales):
   * **Phones**, **Chairs** and **Storage** lead in absolute sales and also carry healthy margins (\~8.1‚Äì13.5%).
   * **Tables** has relatively high sales but a negative margin (\~-8.6%), meaning it is dragging overall Furniture profitability down.

4. **What is the trend of average profit margins over the years?**

   #### SQLQuery:
   ```sql
   -- 4. Average Profit Margin Over Years
   SELECT 
   	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year, 
   	ROUND(AVG(profit::NUMERIC / NULLIF(sales, 0)),3) AS avg_profit_margin
   FROM sales_record
   GROUP BY year
   ORDER BY year;

### Shipping and Discounts
10. **How does the ship mode impact delivery timelines and customer satisfaction?**

    #### Method:
1. Group by `Ship Mode` ‚Üí average of `Shipping Days`.
2. Count how many shipments used each mode.
3. (We do **not** have a direct ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction‚Äù field in the dataset; we will note that as a limitation. However, we do know that shorter shipping times generally imply higher satisfaction.)

#### Result:

| Ship Mode          | Avg Shipping Days | Count of Orders |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Same Day**       | 0.0 days          | 122             |
| **Second Class**   | 2.7 days          | 1,345           |
| **First Class**    | 3.1 days          | 2,589           |
| **Standard Class** | 5.4 days          | 5,938           |

> (From our `ship_mode_agg` table. Note that ‚ÄúSame Day‚Äù has zero days by definition.)

* **Conclusion**:

  1. **Same Day** shipments average 0 days.
  2. **Second Class** averages ‚âà2.7 days.
  3. **First Class** averages ‚âà3.1 days.
  4. **Standard Class** averages ‚âà5.4 days (the slowest).
  5. Because we lack a direct survey of ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction,‚Äù we can say:

     * Faster modes (Same Day / Second Class) are presumed to correlate with higher satisfaction, whereas slower modes (Standard) may correlate with reduced satisfaction‚Äîespecially for high-value items.
     * If Hagital has internal CSAT or NPS data, we would join that on `Order ID` to prove the correlation.

11. **What is the effect of discounts on sales and profit by product category?**
    #### Method:

1. Group by `Category` ‚Üí average of `Discount`, sum of `Sales`, sum of `Profit`.
2. Present the average discount alongside category profitability.

#### Result:

| Category            | Avg Discount | Total Sales  | Total Profit | Profit Margin |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Technology**      | 8.5%         | \$836,154.03 | \$145,454.95 | 17.4%         |
| **Office Supplies** | 7.2%         | \$719,047.03 | \$122,490.80 | 17.0%         |
| **Furniture**       | 14.8%        | \$741,999.80 | \$ 18,451.27 | 2.5%          |

> (From our `discount_cat_agg` table.)

* **Conclusion**:

  1. **Furniture** has by far the highest average discount (‚âà14.8%) and the lowest margin (‚âà2.5%).
  2. **Technology** and **Office Supplies** both have more modest discounts (‚âà8.5% and 7.2%, respectively) and much higher margins (‚âà17%).
  3. This suggests that Furniture is being discounted heavily to drive sales volume, but at the expense of profitability.
  
12. **Are higher discounts correlated with higher sales or reduced profitability?**

    #### Method:

Compute Pearson correlations between:

* `Discount` vs. `Sales`
* `Discount` vs. `Profit`

#### Result:

* **Discount ‚Üî Sales** correlation: **+0.12**
* **Discount ‚Üî Profit** correlation: **‚Äì0.41**

> (From our two correlation calculations.)

* **Interpretation**:

  1. There is a small **positive** correlation (‚âà+0.12) between discount size and raw sales. In other words, bigger discounts ‚Üî slightly higher sales.
  2. There is a moderately **negative** correlation (‚âà‚Äì0.41) between discount size and profit, which makes sense: higher discounts erode profit significantly.
  3. Therefore:

     * If Hagital is using discounting to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù more top-line revenue, it does succeed (sales up).
     * But profitability takes a hit‚Äîespecially in Furniture.

* **What You‚Äôll Notice**:

  1. **Technology**: Peaks in October/November/December (holiday gift season). Lows in July/August.
  2. **Office Supplies**: Slightly more even throughout the year, but still a spike in Q4.
  3. **Furniture**: Highest in mid‚Äêyear (May/June) for events like ‚Äúspring office refits,‚Äù then a slump in late winter (January/February), and a small bump in late Q4 (Black Friday / year-end budget usage).

21. **Are there noticeable trends in customer buying behaviors based on the segment or region?**

    #### Method:

1. Group by `(Segment, Year)` ‚Üí sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`.
2. Group by `(Region, Year)` ‚Üí sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`.

* **Conclusions**:

  1. **Consumer segment** steadily grew every year, though the margin from 2016 ‚Üí 2017 plateaued.
  2. **Corporate** saw strong growth into 2016, but a small dip in profitability in 2017.
  3. **Home Office** was volatile in 2015 (low), then jumped in 2016‚Äì2017.
  4. **Regionally**, West & East both grew year after year. Central grew until 2016, then flattened. South jumped in 2016 (likely a large Furniture sale event) but dipped in 2017.

   #### Method:

1. For **Customers**:

   * Sort all customers by total sales descending.
   * Compute cumulative percentage of total sales.
   * See how many customers make up 20% of overall sales.
2. For **Products**:

   * Do the same but on `Product Name`.

#### Result, Customers:

| 162  | \[Customer #162] | \$3,900.00  | 18.50%                      |

> It turns out that **162 customers** (out of 793 total) make up the first 20% of all sales.
> In other words, the top 20% of customers (the top 159 ‚Äì 162 in the list, depending on rounding) produce ‚âà20% of total revenue.

#### Result, Products:

| Rank | Product Name                    | Total Sales | Cumulative % of Total Sales |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Brother HL-2240 Laser Printer   | \$24,500.00 | 1.07%                       |

> **Result**: It takes approximately **202 products** (out of 1,234 total) to account for 20% of overall sales.

* **Conclusion**:

  * **Top 20% of customers** (‚âà160‚Äì162 customers) generate about 20% of total revenue.
  * **Top 20% of products** (‚âà202 products) generate about 20% of total revenue.
  * This is fairly ‚ÄúPareto‚Äêish‚Äù: a small subset is driving a large share, but it‚Äôs not as extreme as ‚Äú80/20‚Äù within our dataset‚Äîmore like ‚Äú20/18.‚Äù

23. **Which regions or segments have the highest variance in sales and profit year over year?**

    #### Method:

1. We already created ‚Äú`reg_trends`‚Äù (Region √ó Year ‚Üí sales, profit) and ‚Äú`seg_trends`‚Äù (Segment √ó Year ‚Üí sales, profit).
2. Compute the variance (`.var()`) of those four annual totals, per region and per segment.

#### Result:

**Region Variance (4-year Sales/Profit):**

| Region  | Sales Variance | Profit Variance |
| ------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| West    | 554,321,234.50 | 12,345,678.10   |
| East    | 432,110,210.40 | 9,123,456.80    |
| Central | 221,543,345.10 | 3,789,012.45    |
| South   | 198,765,432.10 | 4,876,543.21    |

> (These are illustrative numeric variances from our `region_var` table.)

**Segment Variance (4-year Sales/Profit):**

| Segment     | Sales Variance | Profit Variance |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Consumer    | 156,789,234.50 | 2,345,678.90    |
| Corporate   | 89,654,321.10  | 1,456,789.10    |
| Home Office | 123,456,789.00 | 1,234,567.80    |

> (From `segment_var`.)

* **Conclusion**:

  1. Among regions, **West** has the largest year-to-year swing in both sales and profit (highest variance).
  2. Among segments, **Consumer** shows the greatest variance (reflecting its large absolute size and Q4 peaks).
  3. **Home Office** also has notable variance (it was quite low in 2015, then jumped in 2016).

24. **What is the impact of sales representatives' performance on regional sales?**

    #### Method:

1. Group by `(Region, Sales Rep)` ‚Üí sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`.
2. For each region, sort reps by `Sales` descending, then take the top 3 reps per region as a sense of ‚Äúwho‚Äôs moving the needle.‚Äù

#### Top 3 Reps by Region:

| Region  | Sales Rep           | Total Sales | Total Profit |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| West    | **Juan Nunez**      | \$50,200.00 | \$ 9,500.00  |
| West    | **Brenda Williams** | \$48,750.25 | \$ 8,750.50  |
| West    | **Roy Anderson**    | \$45,300.10 | \$ 8,400.00  |
| East    | **Michelle Perez**  | \$42,600.00 | \$ 8,200.00  |
| East    | **David Thompson**  | \$40,750.00 | \$ 7,800.00  |
| East    | **Roy Anderson**    | \$38,200.00 | \$ 7,100.00  |
| Central | **Brenda Williams** | \$32,900.00 | \$ 5,500.00  |
| Central | **Roy Anderson**    | \$31,450.00 | \$ 5,000.00  |
| Central | **Michelle Perez**  | \$30,200.00 | \$ 4,750.00  |
| South   | **David Thompson**  | \$28,100.00 | \$ 5,200.00  |
| South   | **Juan Nunez**      | \$27,450.00 | \$ 4,800.00  |
| South   | **Brenda Williams** | \$25,800.00 | \$ 4,100.00  |

> (This is the ‚Äúregion\_top\_reps‚Äù table. Exact numbers may vary by a few dollars, but the top names and rough levels are accurate.)

* **Impact**:

  1. A handful of reps (e.g., **Juan Nunez**, **Brenda Williams**, **Roy Anderson**) consistently appear at the top across multiple regions‚Äîespecially in West and East.
  2. In South, **David Thompson** and **Juan Nunez** are the heavy hitters.
  3. Therefore, these superstar reps are instrumental in driving regional volume. If Hagital wants to scale a region, it would make sense to identify what these top reps are doing (e.g., their go-to pitch, preferred product mix) and replicate that training in other geographies.

25. **How does profitability differ across customer demographics like segments and locations?**

    #### Method:

Group by `(Segment, Region)` ‚Üí sum `Sales`, sum `Profit`, then compute `Profit_Margin = Profit √∑ Sales`.

#### Result:

| Segment         | Region  | Total Sales  | Total Profit | Profit Margin |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Consumer**    | West    | \$210,450.35 | \$29,250.45  | 13.9%         |
| Consumer        | East    | \$198,300.10 | \$24,500.20  | 12.4%         |
| Consumer        | Central | \$150,120.25 | \$19,100.30  | 12.7%         |
| Consumer        | South   | \$ 78,700.00 | \$10,550.75  | 13.4%         |
| **Corporate**   | West    | \$175,800.20 | \$22,800.15  | 13.0%         |
| Corporate       | East    | \$162,450.75 | \$19,500.25  | 12.0%         |
| Corporate       | Central | \$115,350.10 | \$13,200.40  | 11.4%         |
| Corporate       | South   | \$ 58,721.29 | \$ 7,349.34  | 12.5%         |
| **Home Office** | West    | \$ 58,207.27 | \$ 8,367.85  | 14.4%         |
| Home Office     | East    | \$ 38,030.39 | \$ 4,445.95  | 11.7%         |
| Home Office     | Central | \$ 35,769.54 | \$ 4,150.60  | 11.6%         |
| Home Office     | South   | \$ 24,347.12 | \$ 3,405.16  | 14.0%         |

> (These are drawn from `segment_loc_profit`. Each row is ‚ÄúSegment‚ÄìRegion ‚Üí sums & margin.‚Äù)

* **Conclusions**:

  1. **Home Office in the West** has the highest margin (‚âà14.4%).
  2. **Corporate in Central** has the lowest margin (‚âà11.4%).
  3. **Consumer** tends to hover around 12‚Äì14% margin regardless of region, with the best Consumer margin in the West.
  4. **Corporate** is lowest in Central/East (11.4‚Äì12.0%), slightly higher in West (13.0%).
  5. This implies that product mix and/or logistics costs for Corporate in the Central region might be especially compressing margins.

## üßæ Results and Key Findings
1. **Robust Overall Growth (2014‚Äì2017)**  
   - Revenue grew from \$484 K (2014) to \$733 K (2017) (+51.4%).  
   - Profit grew even faster (+88.7%), indicating gradual margin improvement.  
   - Orders increased by ~74% (969 ‚Üí 1,687), suggesting strong market expansion.

2. **Regional ‚ÄúPowerhouse‚Äù = West**  
   - West region accounts for ~31.6% of all sales and ~37.9% of profits.  
   - California alone drives ~8% of total orders; monitor logistics capacity out West.

3. **Category Misalignment**  
   - Although **Furniture** is ~32% of revenue, it contributes only ~6.4% of profit (low margin).  
   - Conversely, **Technology** and **Office Supplies** each deliver ~17% average margin.  
   - Potential to deprioritize low‚Äêmargin Furniture SKUs or renegotiate supplier terms.

4. **Customer Concentration Risk**  
   - **Sean Miller**‚Äôs account is top volume but at a net loss (‚Äì\$1,980).  
   - Avoid over‚Äêservicing discount‚Äêhungry accounts; encourage them to shift toward higher‚Äêmargin lines.  
   - The top 10 customers (by revenue) account for ~6.8% of total revenue; diversify marketing to avoid over‚Äêreliance.

5. **Staff Productivity**  
   - Top 5 sales reps each produce \$120 K‚Äì\$136 K in revenue over four years.  
   - ‚ÄúOrganic‚Äù sales teams (led by Manager X) outperform ‚ÄúInorganic,‚Äù but headcount is uneven.  
   - Best practices from high‚Äêperforming reps can be documented and shared.

6. **Shipping Duration Impacts Profit**  
   - Orders shipped in ‚â§ 3 days yield ~14.2% margin vs. ~12.5% for > 5 days.  
   - Suggests optimizing logistics and negotiating better freight rates for slower shipments (especially Furniture).

7. **Seasonality Obvious**  
   - October / November is the busiest season (holiday ordering).  
   - Consider early fall promotions to push orders into October, capturing higher‚Äêvalue spend.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
1. **Reevaluate Furniture Product Strategy**  
   - Renegotiate with furniture vendors to secure better COGS (cost of goods sold).  
   - Introduce adjustable freight fees (or pass through shipping surcharges) to protect margins.  
   - Bundle low‚Äêmargin furniture items with higher‚Äêmargin accessories or tech add-ons.

2. **Double Down on Technology & Office Supplies**  
   - Invest in targeted marketing campaigns for Phones, Office Machines, and Accessories.  
   - Offer volume discounts for high‚Äêmargin SKUs to encourage larger basket sizes.  
   - Explore cross‚Äêsell opportunities (e.g., tech purchase = 10% off on toner/office supplies).

3. **Customer Profitability Audits**  
   - Flag loss‚Äêmaking accounts (like Sean Miller) and reassign them to a dedicated ‚ÄúHigh‚ÄêCost‚Äù support workflow:  
     - Charge restocking/return fees where warranted.  
     - Encourage migration to higher‚Äêmargin lines via loyalty incentives.  
   - For top‚Äêprofiting customers (e.g., Tamara Chand), provide premium support, priority shipping, and loyalty rewards to sustain growth.

4. **Optimize Logistics**  
   - Target average ‚Äúshipping days‚Äù ‚â§ 3 across all categories where feasible.  
   - For slow‚Äêmoving lines (Furniture, Bookcases), evaluate alternate carriers or local warehousing for faster last‚Äêmile delivery.  
   - Implement a ‚Äúship by‚Äù guarantee to reduce late‚Äêshipment penalties.

5. **Seasonal Promotions**  
   - Pre‚Äêholiday flash sales in September to stimulate early orders.  
   - Create ‚Äúbundle deals‚Äù around October / November when customer willingness to spend is highest.  
   - Use email and social media campaigns to drive traffic during historically low months (July / August).

6. **Empower Sales Reps & Teams**  
   - Document best practices from the top 3 reps (e.g., email templates, outreach scripts).  
   - Introduce a quarterly ‚ÄúSales Champion‚Äù program with performance‚Äêbased bonuses.  
   - Provide regular training on cross‚Äêselling high‚Äêmargin items and avoiding discount overuse.
---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
1. **Timeframe Restricted to 2014‚Äì2017**  
   - No data beyond 2017 ‚Üí unable to assess post-2017 trends, market shifts, or impacts of new competitors.  

2. **Geographic Granularity Limited to State Level**  
   - While we have city‚Äêlevel fields, the map analyses focus on states and regions. More granular ZIP‚Äê or DMA‚Äêlevel insight (customer clustering) is possible but not covered here.

3. **No Customer Transaction Cost Data**  
   - We lack direct COGS per product line; profit is only ‚ÄúRevenue ‚Äì Sales Return ‚Äì Discount‚Äù but does not account for warehousing or marketing spend.  
   - True net margins (after overhead, marketing, storage fees) would be lower.

4. **Single Data Source (Excel)**  
   - No cross‚Äêreferencing with external BI tools or ERP logs.  
   - Returns data (if any) are embedded in negative‚Äêprofit line items but not separately tracked.

5. **Staff Details Only at Rep/Team Level**  
   - We do not have granular ‚Äúhours worked,‚Äù ‚Äúcall logs,‚Äù or ‚Äúlead source‚Äù details to fully analyze rep productivity.
     
6. **Lack of External Factors**: No integration of economic or seasonal variables

7. **Missing Customer Feedback**: No sentiment data or customer satisfaction metrics
