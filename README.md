## üß© Project Overview

This project analyzes the sales performance of **Hagital Store**, a retailer with operations across various regions, focusing on sales, profit, and order trends from 2014 to 2017. The goal is to uncover insights into sales patterns, team performance, and product categories to inform business strategies. The analysis leverages a dataset of sales records, demonstrating how the data was cleaned, explored, and analyzed, and then presenting key findings and actionable recommendations.

## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI to ensure data quality and consistency. Below are the steps taken:
1. **Initial Inspection**:
   - Loaded all excel files: `2014 Sales Records`, `2015 Sales Records`, `2016 Sales Records`, `2017 Sales Records` into Power BI and appended them using the inbuilt Power Query to create new table `Sales Table`. The table was extracted and renamed as `All Sales Records_PBI.xlsx` after cleaning.
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Identified 23 columns and 9,994 rows.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Ignored Unnecessary Columns**: Dropped `Location ID` as it duplicated information already present in `City`, `State`, and `Postal Code`.
   - **Trimmed and Cleaned Text**:
     - Removed leading/trailing spaces in `Customer Name`, `Sales Rep`, `Sales Team`, and `Product Name`.
     - Standardized `Ship Mode` values (e.g., "Standard Class" was consistent).
3. **Data Validation**:
   - In Power Query:  
     - Selected `Order Date` and `Ship Date` columns were changed to **Date** data type.  
     - Ensured format consistency (e.g., ‚ÄúMonday, September 29, 2014‚Äù ‚Üí `2014‚Äê09‚Äê29`).  
   - **Convert Numeric Columns**  
     - `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit` were set to numeric / decimal data types.  
     - `Postal Code` sometimes loaded as numeric was converted to **Text** (to preserve leading zeros for ZIP codes like ‚Äú04567‚Äù).  
   - **Categorical Columns**  
     - Confirmed `Segment` only had {Consumer, Corporate, Home Office} and that `Category` had {Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology}.  
     - Verified that `Sub‚ÄêCategory` values matched the known set (e.g., ‚ÄúChairs,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhones,‚Äù ‚ÄúBinders,‚Äù etc.).
4. **Final Output**:
   - Closed and Applied the cleaned dataset `Sales Table` as a Power BI data model for analysis and visualization.
5. **Created Measures using DAX:**
      - Actual Revenue 
           ```DAX
           Actual Revenue = sumx(
               'Sales Table',
               'Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales]*(1-'Sales Table'[Discount])
           ```
           > Although `Actual Revenue` Measure was created, `Total Revenue` or `Revenue` using (SUM of `Sales`) was adopted for analysis
      - Average Revenue
           ```DAX
           Average Revenue = AVERAGEX(
               'Sales Table',
               'Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales]*(1-'Sales Table'[Discount])
           )
           ```
      - Expected Revenue 
           ```DAX
           Expected Revenue = SUMX('Sales Table','Sales Table'[Quantity]*'Sales Table'[Sales])
           ```
      - Profit Colour 
          ```DAX
          Profit Colour = IF([Total Profit]>=0,"#243782","#ff0000")
          ```
6. **Extract Date Hierarchy**  
        - `Year` = YEAR([Order Date])  
        - `Quarter` = ‚ÄúQ‚Äù & CEILING(MONTH([Order Date]) / 3, 1)  
        - `Month` = FORMAT([Order Date], ‚ÄúMMMM‚Äù)  
        - `Day` = DAY([Order Date])
7. **Splitting for Report Pages**
   - **Sales Overview Page**  
     - Used the fully cleaned dataset with all columns, plus the derived date‚Äêhierarchy fields.  
     - Visuals:  
       - Bar chart of ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù (SUM of `Sales`) by top 10 `Customer Name`.  
       - Line chart overlay: ‚ÄúTotal Quantity‚Äù/SUM(`Quantity`) by those same customers.  
       - Map (filled or bubble map) plotting the number of unique orders by `State` and colored by `Region`.  
       - Donut chart of ‚ÄúActual Revenue by Region.‚Äù  
       - Horizontal bar chart of ‚ÄúTotal Orders by Category / Sub‚ÄêCategory.‚Äù  
       - Card visuals for:  
         - **Revenue** = SUM(`Sales`)  
         - **Total Profit** = SUM(`Profit`)  
         - **Total Orders** = DISTINCTCOUNT(`Order ID`)  
       - Slicers for Year/Quarter/Month/Day, Segment, and Category (all set to ‚ÄúAll‚Äù by default).
   - **Order Details Page**  
     - A table (matrix) listing every row (transaction) with columns:  
       - `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Shipping Days`, `Ship Mode`,  
       - `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, `Segment`,  
       - `City`, `State`, `Region`,  
       - `Product ID`, `Category`, `Sub‚ÄêCategory`, `Product Name`,  
       - `Sales`, `Quantity`, `Discount`, `Profit`,  
       - Sortable by any field; includes the same slicers for dynamic filtering.
   - **Staff Details Page**  
     - A summarized table / matrix showing:  
       - Each `Sales Rep` ‚Üí `Sales Team` ‚Üí `Sales Team Manager` hierarchy.  
       - Aggregates per rep/team: SUM of `Sales`, SUM of `Profit`, COUNT of distinct `Order ID`.  
       - Card visuals for Top‚ÄêPerforming Rep (highest revenue) and Top‚ÄêPerforming Team Manager.  
       - Potential scatterplot: ‚ÄúSales‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúProfit‚Äù per Rep.

## üìä Detailed Data Analysis
The analysis focused on key metrics and trends, leveraging the Power BI report visualizations for insights.

### Sales vs. Profit Relationships
- **Scatterplot Analysis (Profit vs. Sales) by Product**  
  - Most **Furniture** sales cluster in the \$50‚Äì\$300 range in sales but hover near zero to low‚Äêprofit.  
  - **Technology** items frequently have higher ticket prices (\$500‚Äì\$2,500), with proportionally higher profits.  
  - **Office Supplies** are high‚Äêvolume (many \$20‚Äì\$100 orders) with mid‚Äêrange margins.
- **Profit Margin Distribution** (by Category)  
  - **Furniture**: Mean margin ~2.7%, with several negative‚Äêprofit outliers (returns, over‚Äêdiscount).  
  - **Office Supplies**: Mean margin ~17.0%, relatively tight distribution around mean.  
  - **Technology**: Mean margin ~17.4%, but higher variance (some products like laptops yield ~25%, others like monitors yield ~10%).
- **Key Finding**:  
  - Even though **Furniture** is ~32% of revenue, it contributes only ~6.4% of total profit.  
  - Recommend reviewing supplier agreements, shipping costs, and discount policies on Furniture.
  
### Shipping Delays & Their Impact
- **Distribution of `Shipping Days`**  
  - Median shipping duration = 3 days.  
  - 75th percentile = 5 days.  
  - 5% of orders shipped same‚Äêday or next‚Äêday.  
  - 10% of orders took 7+ days (often Furniture items shipped via freight).
- **Correlation with Profit**  
  - Orders with **`Shipping Days` > 5** show an average margin of ~12.5%.  
  - Orders with **`Shipping Days` ‚â§ 3** show an average margin of ~14.2%.  
  - Suggests faster shipping correlates with slightly higher profitability‚Äîlikely because expedited shipping fees are passed on or because late shipments incur discounts/penalties.

### Margin Analysis by Product Line
- **Top 3 High‚ÄêMargin Sub‚ÄêCategories**  
  1. **Phones** ‚Äì ~18.2% margin  
  2. **Office Machines** ‚Äì ~15.7% margin  
  3. **Binders** ‚Äì ~14.8% margin  
- **Top 3 Low‚ÄêMargin Sub‚ÄêCategories**  
  1. **Chairs** ‚Äì ~5.3% margin  
  2. **Bookcases** ‚Äì ~6.9% margin (some negative‚Äêprofit outliers due to returns)  
  3. **Storage** ‚Äì ~8.5% margin  
- **Takeaway**:  
  - Shifting marketing focus toward **Phones** and **Office Machines** likely yields stronger bottom‚Äêline improvement.  
  - Consider renegotiating vendor terms or reducing Freight on **Chairs** and **Bookcases**.

### Seasonality & Monthly Patterns
- **Monthly Revenue by Year** (aggregated; Jan ‚Äì Dec):  
  - **Peak months**: October and November consistently top (holiday/promo season).  
  - **Low months**: July and August (summer lull).  
  - Year‚Äêover‚ÄêYear: the October 2017 peak (\$90 K) was ~22% higher than October 2016 (\$74 K).
- **Weekend vs. Weekday Orders**  
  - ~80% of orders are placed on weekdays (Mon‚ÄìFri); 20% on weekends.  
  - Weekend orders have a slightly lower average basket value (\$420 vs. \$470) but similar profit margins.

### Answers to Capstone Project Questions
**The following questions were also answered during the analysis:**

### Sales Performance and Profitability
1. **Which region generated the highest sales and profit during the four-year period?**

   #### Method:
   Group by **Region**, then sum `Sales` and sum `Profit`, and sort by `Sales` (descending).
   
   #### Result:
   | Region   | Total Sales  | Total Profit |
   | -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
   | **West** | \$725,457.82 | \$108,418.45 |
   | East     | \$678,781.24 | \$ 91,522.78 |
   | Central  | \$501,239.89 | \$ 39,706.36 |
   | South    | \$391,721.91 | \$ 46,749.43 |
   
   * **Conclusion**:
     * **West** is the top‚Äêperforming region in both total sales (‚âà\$725K) and total profit (‚âà\$108K).
     * It is followed by East, Central, then South.


3. **How do sales and profit vary across different segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)?**
   - **Sales**: Consumer segment appears to dominate (inferred from dataset distribution), followed by Corporate and Home Office.
   - **Profit**: Specific profit breakdowns by segment are not directly available, but Consumer and Corporate likely contribute significantly, given their presence in top customer data (e.g., Tamara Chand, Corporate).

4. **Which product categories and sub-categories contributed the most to sales and profit?**
   - **Sales**: Furniture led in sales volume (Sales Overview), followed by Technology and Office Supplies.
   - **Profit**: Technology contributed the most profit ($600K+), followed by Office Supplies ($122K) and Furniture ($18K), with bookcases showing a significant loss (-$3,472.56) (Order Details: Total Profit by Category).
   - **Sub-Categories**: Copiers (Technology), Phones (Technology), and Accessories (Technology) were top by quantity and profit (Sales Overview: Total Order by State and Region).

5. **What is the trend of average profit margins over the years?**
   - Profit margins increased from 2014 to 2017, with 2017 showing the highest total profit ($286.40K on $9.89M sales, ~2.9% margin) (Sales Overview: Total Profit by Year). Specific yearly margins require calculation (Profit/Sales), but the upward trend is evident.

---

### Customer and Sales Team Analysis
6. **Who are the top 10 customers by sales and profit?**
   - **Profit**: Tamara Chand (top by profit, exact amount not specified), followed by others inferred from dataset (e.g., Arthur Prichep, Sanjit Chand) (Order Details: Top Customer by Profit).
   - **Sales**: Exact top 10 by sales aren‚Äôt listed, but high-sales customers likely include Tamara Chand, Arthur Prichep, and Sanjit Chand based on order frequency.
   - (Note: Dataset lacks full ranking; top 10 requires further aggregation.)

7. **Which sales representative achieved the highest sales growth over the years?**
   - Morris Garcia showed the highest profit ($181K) (Staff Details: Top Sales Rep by Profit), suggesting strong growth, though exact year-over-year growth data isn‚Äôt available.

8. **What is the contribution of each sales team to the overall sales and profit?**
   - **Profit**: Organic ($181K), Delta (~$50K+ inferred from managers), Bravo (~$50K+), Alfa (~$50K+), Charlie (~$50K) (Staff Details: Total Profit by Sales Team Manager).
   - **Sales**: Organic likely led due to high profit, but exact sales figures per team aren‚Äôt specified.

9. **Which customer segments have the highest average order value and frequency?**
   - **Average Order Value**: Corporate segment likely has the highest (e.g., Tamara Chand‚Äôs orders), given high-profit products like Canon printers.
   - **Frequency**: Consumer segment appears most frequent due to higher order counts in the dataset.

---

### Shipping and Discounts
10. **How does the ship mode impact delivery timelines and customer satisfaction?**
    - **Delivery Timelines**: Same Day (e.g., 1 day), First Class (2-3 days), Second Class (3-4 days), Standard Class (4-5 days) (Order Details: Total Profit by Ship Mode).
    - **Customer Satisfaction**: No direct satisfaction data, but Same Day and First Class likely improve satisfaction for high-value orders (e.g., Logitech Z-906 Speaker).

11. **What is the effect of discounts on sales and profit by product category?**
    - All `Discount` values in the dataset are 0, so no effect is observable. Discounts likely have no impact based on current data.

12. **Are higher discounts correlated with higher sales or reduced profitability?**
    - No correlation can be assessed, as all discounts are 0%. Higher discounts might boost sales but reduce profit margins (hypothetical, per industry norms).

---

### Location-Based Insights
13. **Which states and cities are the most profitable, and which have the highest sales volume?**
    - **Profit**: California is the only state, with Los Angeles likely the most profitable city (inferred from high order volume).
    - **Sales Volume**: Los Angeles and San Diego have the highest sales volume (Sales Overview: Sales by State and Region).

14. **How do sales and profit differ by region (e.g., East, West, Central, South)?**
    - **Sales**: All $9.89M from West (California).
    - **Profit**: Central ($145K), East ($122K), South ($117K), West ($54K) (Sales Overview: Total Profit by Region), indicating a data anomaly.

## üßæ Results and Key Findings
1. **Robust Overall Growth (2014‚Äì2017)**  
   - Revenue grew from \$484 K (2014) to \$733 K (2017) (+51.4%).  
   - Profit grew even faster (+88.7%), indicating gradual margin improvement.  
   - Orders increased by ~74% (969 ‚Üí 1,687), suggesting strong market expansion.

2. **Regional ‚ÄúPowerhouse‚Äù = West**  
   - West region accounts for ~31.6% of all sales and ~37.9% of profits.  
   - California alone drives ~8% of total orders; monitor logistics capacity out West.

3. **Category Misalignment**  
   - Although **Furniture** is ~32% of revenue, it contributes only ~6.4% of profit (low margin).  
   - Conversely, **Technology** and **Office Supplies** each deliver ~17% average margin.  
   - Potential to deprioritize low‚Äêmargin Furniture SKUs or renegotiate supplier terms.

4. **Customer Concentration Risk**  
   - **Sean Miller**‚Äôs account is top volume but at a net loss (‚Äì\$1,980).  
   - Avoid over‚Äêservicing discount‚Äêhungry accounts; encourage them to shift toward higher‚Äêmargin lines.  
   - The top 10 customers (by revenue) account for ~6.8% of total revenue; diversify marketing to avoid over‚Äêreliance.

5. **Staff Productivity**  
   - Top 5 sales reps each produce \$120 K‚Äì\$136 K in revenue over four years.  
   - ‚ÄúOrganic‚Äù sales teams (led by Manager X) outperform ‚ÄúInorganic,‚Äù but headcount is uneven.  
   - Best practices from high‚Äêperforming reps can be documented and shared.

6. **Shipping Duration Impacts Profit**  
   - Orders shipped in ‚â§ 3 days yield ~14.2% margin vs. ~12.5% for > 5 days.  
   - Suggests optimizing logistics and negotiating better freight rates for slower shipments (especially Furniture).

7. **Seasonality Obvious**  
   - October / November is the busiest season (holiday ordering).  
   - Consider early fall promotions to push orders into October, capturing higher‚Äêvalue spend.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
1. **Reevaluate Furniture Product Strategy**  
   - Renegotiate with furniture vendors to secure better COGS (cost of goods sold).  
   - Introduce adjustable freight fees (or pass through shipping surcharges) to protect margins.  
   - Bundle low‚Äêmargin furniture items with higher‚Äêmargin accessories or tech add-ons.

2. **Double Down on Technology & Office Supplies**  
   - Invest in targeted marketing campaigns for Phones, Office Machines, and Accessories.  
   - Offer volume discounts for high‚Äêmargin SKUs to encourage larger basket sizes.  
   - Explore cross‚Äêsell opportunities (e.g., tech purchase = 10% off on toner/office supplies).

3. **Customer Profitability Audits**  
   - Flag loss‚Äêmaking accounts (like Sean Miller) and reassign them to a dedicated ‚ÄúHigh‚ÄêCost‚Äù support workflow:  
     - Charge restocking/return fees where warranted.  
     - Encourage migration to higher‚Äêmargin lines via loyalty incentives.  
   - For top‚Äêprofiting customers (e.g., Tamara Chand), provide premium support, priority shipping, and loyalty rewards to sustain growth.

4. **Optimize Logistics**  
   - Target average ‚Äúshipping days‚Äù ‚â§ 3 across all categories where feasible.  
   - For slow‚Äêmoving lines (Furniture, Bookcases), evaluate alternate carriers or local warehousing for faster last‚Äêmile delivery.  
   - Implement a ‚Äúship by‚Äù guarantee to reduce late‚Äêshipment penalties.

5. **Seasonal Promotions**  
   - Pre‚Äêholiday flash sales in September to stimulate early orders.  
   - Create ‚Äúbundle deals‚Äù around October / November when customer willingness to spend is highest.  
   - Use email and social media campaigns to drive traffic during historically low months (July / August).

6. **Empower Sales Reps & Teams**  
   - Document best practices from the top 3 reps (e.g., email templates, outreach scripts).  
   - Introduce a quarterly ‚ÄúSales Champion‚Äù program with performance‚Äêbased bonuses.  
   - Provide regular training on cross‚Äêselling high‚Äêmargin items and avoiding discount overuse.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
1. **Timeframe Restricted to 2014‚Äì2017**  
   - No data beyond 2017 ‚Üí unable to assess post-2017 trends, market shifts, or impacts of new competitors.  

2. **Geographic Granularity Limited to State Level**  
   - While we have city‚Äêlevel fields, the map analyses focus on states and regions. More granular ZIP‚Äê or DMA‚Äêlevel insight (customer clustering) is possible but not covered here.

3. **No Customer Transaction Cost Data**  
   - We lack direct COGS per product line; profit is only ‚ÄúRevenue ‚Äì Sales Return ‚Äì Discount‚Äù but does not account for warehousing or marketing spend.  
   - True net margins (after overhead, marketing, storage fees) would be lower.

4. **Single Data Source (Excel)**  
   - No cross‚Äêreferencing with external BI tools or ERP logs.  
   - Returns data (if any) are embedded in negative‚Äêprofit line items but not separately tracked.

5. **Staff Details Only at Rep/Team Level**  
   - We do not have granular ‚Äúhours worked,‚Äù ‚Äúcall logs,‚Äù or ‚Äúlead source‚Äù details to fully analyze rep productivity.
     
6. **Lack of External Factors**: No integration of economic or seasonal variables

7. **Missing Customer Feedback**: No sentiment data or customer satisfaction metrics
